 * Extends {@see MalformedResponseException} as a narrower case: the body wasn't malformed at the
 * JSON level, but it didn't conform to the DTO contract (unexpected field type, missing required
 * field, version skew between server and SDK). The original `CuyZ\Valinor\Mapper\MappingError` is
 * preserved as the `$previous` exception for full diagnostic detail.
