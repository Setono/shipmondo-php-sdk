 * Base class for entry-point Response DTOs — the things returned directly by an Endpoint method.
 *
 * Each subclass represents one Shipmondo API resource. Subclasses declare typed `public readonly`
 * constructor-promoted fields for the wire format we model. After Valinor maps the typed fields,
 * the endpoint stamps the full decoded JSON onto `$raw` so consumers can reach any field we
 * haven't yet typed.
 *
 * The class itself is NOT `readonly` (because `$raw` is mutable until the endpoint sets it).
 * Subclasses should be `final class` (not `final readonly class`) — `rector.php` excludes
 * `src/Response` from `ReadOnlyPropertyRector` to keep this invariant.
